## Terms of Business


#### Communication and guidance:

Agreements between the client and developer concerning frequency or methods of communciation in relation to the agreement or project shall form part of the terms of the agreement.


#### Cost:

The developer may agree explictly and in advance that a project will be pro-bono, for non-monetary benefit or for a different rate than his standard rate. Projects involving consultancy or specialist technologies (eg blockchain) are charged at a higher than standard rate. Otherwise and in general, however, work is charged on a daily basis at the developer’s standard rate (£175 per day as of 19th Feb 2019). This rate is exclusive of VAT, which is currently not charged. Days of up to 4 hours (including site vists unless otherwise agreed) are charged as half-days. Where a project requires multiple long days in order to meet a deadline, these may be charged either pro-rata, on the same basis (eg as one-and-a-half-days), or other basis to be agreed ad-hoc.


#### Payment terms:

The developer will periodically produce invoices which will be dated. Payment will be due 14 days after the date that the invoice is delivered to the client unless that period is superceded by these terms, other terms or the agreement. The 14 day due period may be changed by agreement between the developer and client, for example if it does not fit with the client’s payroll cycle.


#### Product liability:

The developer will produce projects on a best effort basis. Software development is an art not a science. Options are available to the client, for example code review, unit and integration testing and test-driven development, service level agreements and design sprints, to ensure quality and reliability. It is the client’s responsibility to specify these and the developer will, of course, be glad to advise.


#### Subcontractors and joint participants:

The developer has the right to subcontract all or part of a project to persons who, in his professional opinion, are of an equal skill level to himself or of a suitable skill level for the project. Where the charging basis is daily or hourly, if those persons are of a different skill level, then the standard rates for those persons will be based on the ‘Daily Rate’ column [here](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/freelancing/blob/master/rates.md) or as agreed. Where those rates are higher than the developer’s standard rate, these will be discussed and agreed with the client.

As regards benefits due to the developer under an agreement with the client, and privity thereto, ‘the developer’ may include any subcontractors, employees or persons introduced to the client to do similar work on the project, except where another agreement or contract substantially supersedes all or part of these terms. In particular, standard rates mentioned in these terms do not take precedence over rates agreed through the developer, or rates agreed with persons the developer introduces to the client in advance of work undertaken by those persons.


#### Access:

Until payment for a project is complete, the developer may obfuscate, minify or otherwise restrict access to the code, use copy-protection methods, restrict access to services which are part of the project, withhold or introduce password protection, permissions or account ownership, including to third party services. However (so long as the client does not act in bad faith) the developer will nonetheless ensure the client has access to the project.


#### Intellectual Property:

Where no payment is outstanding (and subject to the client covering the cost of any third party services), the client has:
    • the right to use any part of the project; and
    • revocable consent to continue to develop the project.
Intellectual property will, absent any specific agreement or license, remain property of the developer. Following completion of the project and agreement, the client may request release or assignation of all or part of the IP. Where the project is based wholly in common technologies (eg React, SQL, MongoDB, Express) and is not exceptionally complex, then release will not usually be chargeable and will not unreasonably be refused.
The grant of any IP excludes permission to use any logos of, or references to, the developer or project participants, though this permission is granted nonetheless on condition that they are not misused or their context changed in a way which may cause damage.


#### Risk:

The developer may determine, before or during the course of the agreement, that the project is or has become risky.

Where ‘risky’ refers to an increased risk of non-payment by the client, this is likely to be due to one or more of the following:
    • in the developer’s opinion, the client is at risk of insolvency, is wilfully dishonest regarding terms or payment, is uncontactable without explanation for necessary communication, or is incoherent in necessary communication;
    • the developer reasonably concludes that, contrary to the client’s representations, the client is not commited to the completion of the contract;
    • the client’s assets are held offshore or in some form effectively out of the reach of UK courts;
    • in the developer’s opinion, the client seems likely to disappear;
    • previous payments have been overdue unreasonably or without explanation


Where ‘risky’ refers to an increased risk of non-completion of the contract, this is likely to be due to one or more of the following:
    * the project specification lacks the necessary clarity, given the stage of the project, to identify whether a given result would fulfil the spec. (A full upfront spec is good, but most projects will require ongoing client input as they progress);
    * the client’s action or inaction creates extra work for the developer or persons working on the project, and it is unclear whether the client thereby knowingly assumes the extra costs involved in that extra work;
    * the client or client’s own contractors or project contributors fail to provide APIs, credentials, reasonable documentation, or other parts of the project or permissions which are necessary for the completion of the project (except where those contractors or contributors are acting under the direction of the developer as tech lead)


Where the developer determines a project to be risky, the developer may require full or partial upfront payment on terms other than those agreed. Typically, this will be:
if, at the time of the developer requiring payment, less than half the work (in the developer’s opinion) has been completed: 50%, or;  otherwise: 80%, to be paid immediately.

The developer may determine that a project is risky on the basis of new information or information which was was available at an earlier time.
Where the developer determines that a project is risky, this is not necessarily final and the client will always have the right to seek to change that determination. Where the developer has required payment on new terms, however, payment remains due unless the developer agrees the contrary in writing.

The client shall bear the increased risk of delay and the costs involved in reducing the risks where the risks are due to its own failures or those of its contractors or contributors. For example - where the developer must spend a significant amount of time chasing other contractors or contributors for APIs to services, or documenting or reverse-engineering others’ undocumented code, this is chargeable work. The client may not be at fault for the failures of third parties, but the client bears the risk.

These costs will be those which, in the developer’s opinion, are necessary to reduce the costs which would be necessary elsewhere in ensuring the agreement or project is completed, or completed without substantial delay.


#### Disappearing Clients:

In the event of payments which are overdue by more than two weeks, the developer will attempt to contact the client via at least two written means. If no  satisfactory response is received within a further two weeks, the developer may use information under its control or the control of third parties, and any technical means to obtain information necessary to:
* locate;
* locate contact details for;
* ascertain an appropriate service address for;
* ascertain the financial position of;
* ascertain the location of any assets of;
* recover any sums from;
the client or any jointly liable parties, including accessing the client’s systems or services and obtaining information from third parties, to which the client hereby consents and consents to the release of such information as necessary for the above.
restrict access to any part of the project worked on by the developer or his subcontractors
